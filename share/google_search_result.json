    "description": "A Tale of Two Cities (1859) is set against the backdrop of the French Revolution and the reign of terror that followed. The story takes us back and forth between London and Paris-the two cities-and revolves around the lives of Lucie Manette and Charles Darnay. Against the grim background of the guillotine, unfolds a tale of adventure and mystery, heroism and courage. We see the quintessential Dickens as he vividly portrays the trials and tribulations of the poor at the hands of the rich, before the Revolution and the mindless mayhem that follows it. This historical novel is unusual for Dickens, whose other major works are set in Victorian England.",

    "description": "Since its publication in 1859, A Tale of Two Cities has remained the best-known fictional recreation of the French Revolution, and one of Charles Dickens¿s most exciting novels. A Tale of Two Cities blends a moving love story with the familiar figures of the Revolution¿Bastille prisoners, a starving Parisian mob, and an indolent aristocracy. Taking the form of a sourcebook, this guide to Dickens's dramatic novel offers: extensive introductory comment on the contexts and many interpretations of the text, from publication to the present annotated extracts from key contextual documents, reviews, critical works and the text itself cross-references between documents and sections of the guide, in order to suggest links between texts, contexts and criticism suggestions for further reading. This volume is essential reading for all those beginning detailed study of A Tale of Two Cities and seeking not only a guide to the novel, but a way through the wealth of contextual and critical material that surrounds Dickens' text.",
